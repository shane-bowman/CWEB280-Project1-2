CWEB Pokémon Web Application
## Overview
This Pokémon Web Application was developed for CWEB280 at Saskatchewan Polytechnic as part of our coursework by Shane Bowman and Zach Linzmeyer. It’s a web-based project that allows users to explore Pokémon data, leveraging the PokéAPI for dynamic content. The app includes features like user authentication, session tracking, and form autofill, showcasing our skills in web development and API integration.

## Features

Pokémon Data Fetching: Retrieve and display Pokémon lists and detailed attributes (e.g., types, stats) using the PokéAPI.
Type Filtering: Filter Pokémon by type for a tailored browsing experience.
Google Authentication: Secure user login via Google OAuth using Passport.js.
Session-Based Activity Tracking: Log recent user activities (e.g., viewed Pokémon) with session management.
Cookie-Based Form Autofill: Enhance user experience by auto-filling forms based on previous inputs.
Image Upload: Allow users to upload images, integrated with session data.
